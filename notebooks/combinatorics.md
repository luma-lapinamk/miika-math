# {index}`Combinatorics`
Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement and combination of objects or elements. It focuses on studying the ways in which simple discrete objects can be organized, combined or chosen. For instance, it is pretty easy to compute the amount of numbers with three figures but it is much harder to find all the possible arrengements for a bookshelf.

## {index}`Multiplication principle`
also known as **Rule of product**. When making multiple consecutive choices, the total number of possibilities is obtained by multiplying the respective numbers of options available at each choice stage. Intuitively it can expressed as "if there are $a$ ways of doing something and $a$ ways of doing another thing, then there are $a \cdot b$ ways of performing both actions.

The principle can be described by a ladder model.

**Example.** A student has two knitted caps, two jumpsuits and three pairs of shoes. How many different sets of outfits can be created from these pieces of clothing?

The number of different sets of outfits can be computed from the bottom row of the ladder moddel.

The cap can be chosen in two different ways, the jumpsuit can be chosen from two different options and there are three different pairs of shoes. Using the multiplication principle we can compute the number of different sets by $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 12$.

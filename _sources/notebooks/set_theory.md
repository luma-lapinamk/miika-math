# {index}`Set theory`
## Introduction
Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of collections of objects, called sets. These objects can be anything: numbers, letters, colors, or even other sets. Set theory provides a formal framework for understanding and analyzing the relationships between these collections, forming the basis for many areas of mathematics and other disciplines.

## Basic concepts
**Sets and Elements:** A {index}`set` is a collection of distinct objects, that share a *common characteristic*. In set theory, these objects are called {index}`element`s. A set is denoted by a capital letter, e.g. $A$, $B$ and its elements are listed inside curly brackets $\{\dots\}$. For example, set $A$ of whole numbers greater than 3 but less than 9 is $A=\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$. An element either belongs to a set or it doesn't. When an element belongs to set $A$, it is denoted as $4 \in A$. If it doesn't, the notation is $3 \notin A$

**Universal set** and **empty set:** The {index}`universal set`, denoted by $U$, is the set that contains all the elements under consideration. An {index}`empty set` is denoted by $\{\}$ or $\emptyset$ and contains no elements.

**Subset:** Set $A$ is a {index}`subset` of another set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. Symbolically this can be expressed as $A \subseteq B$. If $A$ is a subset of $B$ but not equal as $B$ $(A \not= B)$, it is called a **{index}`proper subset`**, and it is denoted by $A \subset B$.

>- $A \subseteq B$ means that $A$ is a subset of $B$, and $A$ could potentially be equal to $B$.
>- $A \subset B$ means that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, indicating that $A$ is strictly contained within $B$ and is not equal to $B$.
>- It's important to note that a set is always considered a subset of itself. That is, if $A$ is a set, then $A \subseteq A$.

**Complement of a set:** The {index}`complement of a set` $A$ in relation to the universal set $U$, denoted by $-A$ $($ or $A^â€²$ or $A^c)$, contains all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$. Mathematically, the complement of a $A$ os defined by $-A = \{x \in U \mid x \notin A\}$.

**Union:** The {index}`union` of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$, contains all elements that are in either $A$ or $B$, or both. Mathematically put $A \cup B = \{x \in U \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$.

**Intersection:** The {index}`intersection` of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$, is the set of elements that are in both $A$ and $B$. Mathematically $A \cap B = \{x \in U \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$.

**Set difference:** The {index}`set difference` between sets $A$ and $B$ consists of all the elements that are in set $A$ but not in set $B$. In other words, $A-B$ contains the elements that are exclusive to set $A$ and are not shared with set $B$. Mathematically $A-B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}$.
> Note that usually $A-B \not= B-A$, so the order of subtraction matters.

### Examples
Let $A=\{1,2,3\}$, $B=\{1,2,3,4\}$, $C=\{3,4,5\}$ and $U=\{1,2,3, \dots ,9\}$.<br><br>

a) $1 \in A$ and $1 \in B$ but $1 \notin C$.

b) $A \subseteq B$ but also $A \subset B$.

c) Complement of a $A$ is $-A=\{4,5,6,7,8,9\}$.

d) Union of $A$ and $C$ is $A \cup C =\{1,2,3,4,5\}$.

e) Intersection of $A$ and $C$ is  $A \cap C =\{3\}$.

f) Set difference of $A$ and $C$ is $A-C=\{1,2\}$ but $A-B=\emptyset$.
